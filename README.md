With May being Mental Health Awareness Month, I took the opportunity to examine suicide rates among young people (15-35 years old) in five East African countries: Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, and Rwanda. This period (2009-2019) coincides with increasing efforts to address mental health issues in the region.![image](https://github.com/segeza/East-Africa-suicide-trends-for-10-years-among-people-of-young-age/assets/171006102/141aa239-5c93-44fd-ac13-d510e19943ac)
